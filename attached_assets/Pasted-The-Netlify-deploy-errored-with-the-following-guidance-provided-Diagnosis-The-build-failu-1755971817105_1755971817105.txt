The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to an error setting the Python version to 3.13 during the installation of dependencies.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the required Python version (3.13) is specified correctly in the project configuration files or dependencies.
2. Check if the Python version 3.13 is supported by the build environment and if it is available for installation.
3. If the Python version is correct and supported, update the configuration to ensure proper installation steps for Python 3.13.
4. If needed, consider adjusting the Python version to a supported version in the project configuration to resolve the installation error.

For further assistance on changing Node versions in the build environment, refer to the documentation for [changing Node versions](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript).
